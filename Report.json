While effort was evident, responses at times were generic and uncertain on advanced topics. If the role focuses on Databricks, PySpark, and SQL, the candidate has a moderate to high chance for the next round. However, if leadership, cloud automation, or deep architectural knowledge is required, further improvement is needed. Strengthening hands-on project examples and providing clearer explanations of security and orchestration concepts will help improve performance."

The interviewer provided a common coding platform and a problem statement for the candidate to solve. While typing, one of the shadow Indian interviewers suspected the use of an AI tool and asked the candidate to reshare the screen, which caused a 5-minute delay. The total round duration was 1 hour, but only 45 minutes were allocated to the candidate, which affected their ability to produce a runnable code perfectly. The candidate did provide the approach but couldn't complete the code due to time constraints"

She demonstrated strong technical skills in SQL, ETL, cloud technologies, and data engineering, aligning well with the JD. However, lack of direct R Shiny experience could be a concern, though her expertise in Power BI, Tableau, and Python makes her adaptable. She handled questions on pressure, teamwork, and multitasking effectively, showcasing a problem-solving mindset. If R Shiny is not a strict requirement, she is a strong candidate for the next round. If rejected, it would likely be due to R Shiny experience preference or industry-specific knowledge gaps."

He performed well, but he made a few mistakes. I also faced an issue during this part because I couldn't see the candidate's screen. This was because the candidate was using a Mac, which caused compatibility problems. The scenario was that when the candidate shared their screen, we could only see the particular tab they were sharing. The interviewer shared a link that opened in another window at that time, so I had trouble seeing the code. But overall, the interview went well."

He mentioned that he couldn't view the document properly on his phone as it was too small, which slowed him down, and he wrote some incorrect parts, which I highlighted, and he corrected them.

So very low possibility for next steps with this company now. I have provided her feedback to keep in mind about these 2 points for further interviews as this was just her first interview."

Finally, I provided a third version, which was thoroughly tested in my environment. All the codes worked and produced the correct output. However, instead of using the final tested version, the participant chose an alternative approach and wrote their own code using an array-based structure. While this simpler approach worked, it may have limitations, especially in the final round were handling multiple dropdowns (n dropdowns) is required.

Python list comprehensions, SQL window functions (LEAD/LAG), and WMS-specific workflows should be revisited.

He lost confidence when the interviewer asked about the specifics of a website in a question and dig deeper into that. Also for SQL concept questions, he was 100% dependent on document and couldn't answer till he received the answer for that. Mostly this was the final round.

The candidate showed strong technical competency, problem-solving skills, and adaptability, making it highly likely they will advance to the next round (85% probability).

During one technical question, the interviewer asked the candidate to share his screen, but Yaz was unable to do so. The interviewer then provided a coding question. Since Yaz usually connects via his phone, I couldn\u2019t see the coding question clearly, but the candidate type down the question in my document and i sent him the solution . Yaz then provided the solution to the interviewer. However, i had a feeling that the interviewer might have already known that he is seeing form somewhere"

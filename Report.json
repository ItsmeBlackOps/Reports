To advance to the next round, the candidate should focus on refining their communication and providing more structured, concise answers during technical discussions. Overall, there is potential, especially for hands-on or design-focused rounds, with slight improvements in technical articulation."

However, some answers lacked depth and real-world implementation details, particularly in workflow automation, cluster optimization, and access control policies. While effort was evident, responses at times were generic and uncertain on advanced topics. If the role focuses on Databricks, PySpark, and SQL, the candidate has a moderate to high chance for the next round. However, if leadership, cloud automation, or deep architectural knowledge is required, further improvement is needed. Strengthening hands-on project examples and providing clearer explanations of security and orchestration concepts will help improve performance."

However, responses on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modeling lacked depth and clarity. While effort was evident, some answers were unstructured and repetitive, affecting overall communication. The candidate could improve by providing more structured responses (STAR method), confidently explaining CLV models, and refining data visualization insights for marketing teams. Given these factors, the likelihood of moving to the next round is moderate, but stronger articulation of key concepts would significantly improve the chances."

However, during the rapid-fire questioning, it became apparent to the CEO that her responses seemed polished and potentially influenced by AI, which may have affected her perceived authenticity.

Even after all this, the interviewer stated that there will be a second round (in person) but candidate immediately said NO for in-person interview due to her fear, not location.

The answers came on time, in some seconds as usual but since he was cross questioning in few questions, I had to change answers every 5 seconds. He lost confidence when the interviewer asked about the specifics of a website in a question and dig deeper into that. Also for SQL concept questions, he was 100% dependent on document and couldn't answer till he received the answer for that. Mostly this was the final round. Still I feel there is some chance as the initial part of interview went well and the previous rounds went very well."
